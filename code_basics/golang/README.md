# Code Basics: Go
## This subproject includes my solutions for Code Basics'  [Go language practical course](https://code-basics.com/ru/languages/go).
***
### [Foundations](https://github.com/AlexeyKuzko/study_projects/tree/main/code_basics_go/1_foundations)
Go is a strongly-typed language with a concise and simple syntax. In the first module, we will look at the basics of the language's constructs.

### [Collections](https://github.com/AlexeyKuzko/study_projects/tree/main/code_basics_go/2_collections)
In Go, collections are represented by three types: arrays, slices, and maps. Each type has its own characteristics that we will explore in this module.

### [Strings](https://github.com/AlexeyKuzko/study_projects/tree/main/code_basics_go/3_strings)
The third module will focus on how strings are structured and how to manipulate them. We will also learn about runes and why they exist in Go. Finally, we will examine the most common string functions.

### [Functions & Methods](https://github.com/AlexeyKuzko/study_projects/tree/main/code_basics_go/4_functions_methods)
This module will delve deeper into functions. We'll explore methods for structures and custom types, as well as variable functions, interfaces, error handling, and deferred functions.

### [Concurency](https://github.com/AlexeyKuzko/study_projects/tree/main/code_basics_go/5_concurency)
In this module, we will be introduced to competitive programming. Let's learn about goroutines and how to communicate between them using channels.
